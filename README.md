# Pokémon Memory Game

The game starts with all the pokémon cards and the player must try to click one time every card. If the player clicks on the same card two times the game ends or if you run out of time!. You can choose between different difficulties or pokémon generations. This app was made using [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch all the information and images used in the pokémon cards.
